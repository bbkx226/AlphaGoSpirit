# Opac1ty
By Team AlphaGoSpirit <br />

Opac1ty is a decentralized finance (DeFi) crypto wallet web application that allows users to securely store, manage and transact their cryptocurrency assets. The app is built on a decentralized blockchain network, which means that users have full control over their funds without the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions.
